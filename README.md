# ⚡ Coulomb's Law
This is a simple Python program that calculates the electric force (F) between two charged particles based on Coulomb's Law.
The program prompts the user to input the magnitude of the two charges (Q1​ and Q2​) in Coulombs, and the distance (r) between them in meters.

Key Features

Core Physics Calculation: Implements the full Coulomb's Law formula:

It uses the required value for the permittivity of free space (ε=8.854×10−12 Farads/m).

Scientific Notation Support: The code is designed to accept and correctly process input for extremely small or large numbers using E-notation (e.g., 1.6e-19).

Precision Output: The final result for the electric force is displayed in scientific notation and rounded to 4 decimal places (:.4e), which is essential for accurately presenting results in physics involving very small forces.
